### Decisions

I chose React Router because it's a easy quick set up with tailwind for quick styling. I've also used Mantine UI for quick components that I am familiar with.
As for state management, I've used useContext hook because it's enough for this quick small project and there's no need for complex data management like Redux.
Hope to chat soon, LiveX!
